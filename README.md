# TbSync
[Thunderbird Add-On] Sync contacts and calendar to thunderbird using Exchange Active Sync (EAS). 

## How to get started

A quick start guide on how to use this Add-On can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/jobisoft/TbSync/wiki/How-to-get-started) of this repository

## Roadmap

This is work in progress. Future releases will be as follows:

* v0.7.0: get all calendar stuff done (MeetingStatus, Attendees, Attachements, Repeated Events)
* v0.7.5: add support for tasks
* v0.8.0: rewrite contacts part (it is still using original TzPush code, but I want to use a different method, which is more easy to maintain) and fix a few bugs
* v0.8.5: add support for global address book (if possible)
* v0.9: release candidate for productive use
* v1.0: stable release
