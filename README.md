# TbSync

[TbSync](https://addons.thunderbird.net/addon/tbsync/) is a central user interface to manage cloud accounts and to synchronize their contact, task and calendar information with [Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/). Its main objective is to simplify the setup process for such accounts. Thunderbird is working on a new account-hub UI, which will make TbSync obsolete.
