## Roadmap for 2018

This is work in progress. Future releases will be as follows:

* v0.7.0: get all calendar stuff done:
  - MeetingStatus
  - Attendees (added in 0.6.8.3)
  - Attachements (needs EAS v16.0, this will take longer)
  - repeated Events
* v0.7.1: rewrite contacts part (it is still using original TzPush code, but I want to use a different method, which is more easy to maintain) and fix a few bugs
* v0.7.2: add support for tasks
* v0.7.3: add support for global address book (if possible)
* v0.7.4: add support for push sync ([heartbeat/ping](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff459598.aspx)) 
* v0.9: release candidate for productive use
* v1.0: stable release
