About this Documentation
========================

This document tries to cover all aspects of how to create a provider add-on for TbSync to extends its sync capabilities. 

.. note::
  All TbSync provider add-ons are currently designed as *bootrapped extensions*, for which support is probably going to be dropped from Thunderbird at some time. We are working on migrating the TbSync API into a WebExtension API, so - hopefully - all provider add-ons can be converted into future proof *WebExtensions* without much effort.
